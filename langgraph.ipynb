      "\n",
      "**Task Description:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Your task is to extract specific entities from legal contracts using a language model. The entities to be extracted are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Parties Involved**: The names of the entities entering into the contract.\n",
      "2. **Effective Date**: The date when the contract comes into effect.\n",
      "3. **Termination Date**: The date when the contract ends or the conditions under which it can be terminated.\n",
      "4. **Governing Law**: The legal jurisdiction under which the contract is governed. For example, if there are multiple governing laws, use 'Governing Law': [\"Jurisdiction1\", \"Jurisdiction2\"].\n",
      "5. **Obligations and Responsibilities**: The key obligations and responsibilities of each party. If there are multiple obligations for a party, list them as an array.\n",
      "6. **Initial Term**: The initial duration of the contract.\n",
      "7. **Renewal Terms**: Conditions under which the contract can be renewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output Format:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The extracted information should be presented in the following structured format:\n",
      "\n",

      "This Agreement is made and entered into on the 1st day of January, 2023, by and between Company A and Company B. The Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.\n",
      "\n",
      "Company A agrees to provide software development services, while Company B agrees to pay for these services. The initial term of this Agreement is one year, with an option to renew for additional one-year periods upon mutual agreement of the parties.\n",

      "**Guidelines:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ensure that all entities are accurately extracted and formatted as specified.\n",
      "2. If the contract contains nested or complex conditions, list each condition separately within the relevant field.\n",
      "3. If any entity is not explicitly mentioned in the contract, leave the corresponding field empty in the output.\n",
      "4. Use a consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for all dates.\n",

      "This revised prompt addresses the issues\n",
      "Feedback by GPT-4o: **Evaluation of the Prompt:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clarity:** 9/10\n",
      "- The prompt is generally clear and easy to understand. It provides a detailed task description, a structured output format, and an example legal contract with the corresponding output. \n",
      "- The guidelines are straightforward and help ensure consistency in the extracted information.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Specificity:** 9/10\n",
      "- The prompt specifies the exact entities to be extracted and how they should be formatted in the output. \n",
      "- The example contract and output provide a concrete illustration of what is expected, which helps clarify any ambiguities.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Effectiveness:** 8/10\n",
      "- The prompt is effective in guiding the user to extract the required entities from legal contracts. \n",
      "- The structured format and example output ensure that the user knows exactly what the final result should look like.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Flaws:**\n",
      "1. **Complex Contracts:** The prompt does not address how to handle contracts with more complex structures or multiple sections. It mentions nested or complex conditions but does not provide an example of such a scenario.\n",
      "2. **Partial Information:** The prompt suggests leaving fields empty if entities are not explicitly mentioned, but it could be more effective if it provided guidance on how to handle partial information or ambiguous cases.\n",
      "3. **Date Format Consistency:** While the prompt specifies using a consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD), it does not emphasize the importance of converting dates from different formats found in the contract text (e.g., \"1st day of January, 2023\").\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n",
      "1. **Complex Contracts Example:** Include an example with more complex contract structures or multiple sections to better illustrate how to handle such cases.\n",
      "2. **Handling Ambiguities:** Provide guidance on how to handle partial information or ambiguous cases, such as when a termination date is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.\n",
      "3. **Date Conversion:** Emphasize the importance of converting dates from various formats found in the contract text to the specified format (YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the prompt is well-constructed and provides clear instructions, but it could benefit from additional examples and guidance on handling more complex scenarios and ambiguous information.\n"
